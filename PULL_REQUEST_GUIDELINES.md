# PR Summary Guidelines

1. **Start with the "why"** — Lead with the problem or goal, not implementation details; reviewers need context first

2. **Be concise but complete** — Cover what changed, why, and key decisions without restating every line of code

3. **Call out risks and edge cases** — Use a "Notes" section to flag potential breaking changes or areas of uncertainty

4. **Confirm test coverage** — Note that tests have been added and highlight any noteworthy edge cases covered

5. **Keep the scope clear** — Note if something is intentionally left out or part of a larger effort

6. **Avoid excessive formatting** — Only use section headers when needed; the intro paragraph doesn't need a title, but the PR itself should have a title

7. **Link to resolved issues** — End with "Resolves #ISSUE" only if the PR has multiple commits and none already contain a closing keyword (Fixes, Closes, Resolves, etc.)
