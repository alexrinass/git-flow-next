# GIT-FLOW-FINISH(1)

## NAME

git-flow-finish - Complete and merge topic branches

## SYNOPSIS

**git-flow** *topic* **finish** [*name*] [*options*]

**git-flow finish** [*options*]

## DESCRIPTION

Complete a topic branch by merging it to its parent branch according to the configured merge strategy. This command works with any topic branch type (feature, release, hotfix, support, or custom types).

The finish operation follows a strict state machine with these steps:
1. **Merge**: Merges the topic branch to its parent branch using the configured upstream strategy
2. **Create Tag**: Optionally creates and signs tags (if configured)
3. **Update Children**: Updates any child branches that have `autoUpdate=true` using their downstream strategies
4. **Delete Branch**: Optionally deletes the topic branch (local and/or remote)

The operation maintains a persistent state file that allows it to resume after conflicts. If conflicts occur during any merge operation (main merge or child updates), the state is saved and the operation can be continued with **--continue** or aborted with **--abort**.

## ARGUMENTS

*topic*
: The topic branch type (feature, release, hotfix, support, or any configured custom type)

*name*
: Name of the topic branch to finish. If omitted when using the shorthand **git-flow finish**, the current branch is used.

## OPTIONS

### Operation Control

**--continue**, **-c**
: Continue the finish operation after resolving merge conflicts

**--abort**, **-a**
: Abort the finish operation and return to the original state

**--force**, **-f**
: Force finish a non-standard branch using this branch type's strategy

### Tag Creation

**--tag**
: Create a tag for the finished branch (overrides configuration)

**--notag**
: Don't create a tag for the finished branch (overrides configuration)

**--sign**
: Sign the tag cryptographically with GPG

**--no-sign**
: Don't sign the tag cryptographically

**--signingkey** *keyid*
: Use the given GPG key for the digital signature

**--message**, **-m** *message*
: Use the given message for the tag

**--messagefile** *file*
: Use contents of the given file as tag message

**--tagname** *name*
: Use the given tag name instead of the default

### Branch Retention

**--keep**
: Keep the topic branch after finishing (don't delete)

**--no-keep**
: Delete the topic branch after finishing (default behavior)

**--keepremote**
: Keep the remote tracking branch after finishing

**--no-keepremote**
: Delete the remote tracking branch after finishing

**--keeplocal**
: Keep the local branch after finishing

**--no-keeplocal**
: Delete the local branch after finishing

**--force-delete**
: Force delete the branch even if not fully merged

**--no-force-delete**
: Don't force delete the branch (default)

### Merge Strategy Control

**--rebase**
: Rebase topic branch before merging (overrides configured strategy)

**--no-rebase**
: Don't rebase topic branch (use configured strategy)

**--squash**
: Squash all commits into single commit (overrides configured strategy)

**--no-squash**
: Keep individual commits (don't squash)

**--preserve-merges**
: Preserve merges during rebase operations

**--no-preserve-merges**
: Flatten merges during rebase (default)

**--no-ff**
: Create merge commit even for fast-forward cases

**--ff**
: Allow fast-forward merge when possible (default)

### Remote Fetch Options

**--fetch**
: Fetch from remote before finishing the branch. This ensures the latest remote changes are incorporated before merging. Overrides git config setting `gitflow.<type>.finish.fetch`.

**--no-fetch**
: Don't fetch from remote before finishing. Overrides git config setting `gitflow.<type>.finish.fetch`.

## MERGE STRATEGIES

The merge strategy used when finishing follows a three-layer precedence system:

**merge**
: Standard Git merge creating a merge commit (preserves branch history)

**rebase**
: Rebase topic branch onto parent creating linear history

**squash**
: Combine all topic branch commits into a single commit

### Strategy Precedence

The merge strategy follows a three-layer precedence system (highest to lowest):

1. **Command-line flags**: `--rebase`, `--squash`, `--no-rebase`, `--no-squash` (highest priority)
2. **Command-specific config**: `gitflow.<type>.finish.rebase`, `gitflow.<type>.finish.squash`
3. **Branch defaults**: `gitflow.branch.<type>.upstreamstrategy` (lowest priority)

### Additional Options

The following options modify strategy behavior:

- **--preserve-merges**: Only valid with rebase operations
- **--no-ff**: Forces creation of merge commits, even for fast-forward cases
- **--ff**: Allows fast-forward merges when possible (default)

## EXAMPLES

### Basic Usage

Finish current topic branch (shorthand):
```bash
git flow finish
```

Finish specific feature branch:
```bash
git flow feature finish user-authentication
```

Finish release branch with tag:
```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0 --tag
```

### Handling Conflicts

When conflicts occur during finish:
```bash
# Start finish operation
git flow feature finish my-feature

# Conflicts occur, resolve them manually
git add conflicted-files
git commit

# Continue the finish operation
git flow feature finish my-feature --continue
```

Or abort if needed:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --abort
```

### Tag Management

Create signed tag with custom message:
```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0 --sign --message "Release version 1.2.0"
```

Use specific GPG key:
```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0 --sign --signingkey ABC123DEF
```

### Merge Strategy Examples

Force rebase strategy regardless of configuration:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --rebase
```

Squash all commits into single commit:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --squash
```

Rebase with preserved merges:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --rebase --preserve-merges
```

Create merge commit even for fast-forward:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --no-ff
```

Override configured squash with regular merge:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --no-squash
```

### Branch Retention

Keep branch for backporting:
```bash
git flow hotfix finish 1.1.1 --keep
```

Clean up both local and remote:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --no-keeplocal --no-keepremote
```

## WORKFLOW BEHAVIOR

### Dual Merge Pattern

For release and hotfix branches, finish typically performs dual merges:
1. **Topic → Parent**: Merge the topic branch to its parent (e.g., release → main)
2. **Parent → Develop**: Merge parent back to develop to synchronize branches

### Child Branch Updates

After merging to the parent, any child branches configured with `autoUpdate=true` will be automatically updated with the new changes from their parent branch. Each child branch uses its own configured downstream strategy for receiving updates.

The update process:
1. Checks out each child branch in sequence
2. Merges the parent branch using the child's downstream strategy
3. If conflicts occur, saves state and prompts for resolution
4. Continues with next child branch after successful update

Only branches with `autoUpdate=true` are updated:
```bash
git config gitflow.branch.develop.autoUpdate true
```

## CONFIGURATION

Finish behavior is controlled by these configuration keys:

### Branch-Level Defaults
```bash
git config gitflow.branch.<type>.upstreamStrategy merge
git config gitflow.branch.<type>.tag true
```

### Command-Level Overrides
```bash
# Merge strategy overrides
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.rebase true
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.squash false
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.preserve-merges true
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.no-ff true

# Tag creation overrides
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.sign true
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.signingkey ABC123DEF

# Remote fetch options
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.fetch true
```

## EXIT STATUS

**0**
: Successful finish operation

**1**
: Topic branch not found

**2**
: Git operation failed (conflicts, etc.)

**3**
: Invalid branch name or configuration

**4**
: Merge conflicts require manual resolution

**5**
: Tag creation failed

**6**
: GPG signing failed

## NOTES

- Merge strategy follows three-layer precedence: CLI flags > config > branch defaults
- Command-line flags always override any configuration settings
- **--preserve-merges** flag only applies to rebase operations
- **--squash** and **--rebase** flags are mutually exclusive when both set explicitly
- Use **--continue** and **--abort** for conflict resolution
- Tag creation behavior varies by topic branch type configuration  
- The **git-flow finish** shorthand automatically detects current topic branch type
- Child branches are automatically updated when their parent changes
- Some topic branch types (like releases and hotfixes) may create tags by default
