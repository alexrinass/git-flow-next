# GIT-FLOW-FINISH(1)

## NAME

git-flow-finish - Complete and merge topic branches

## SYNOPSIS

**git-flow** *topic* **finish** [*name*] [*options*]

**git-flow finish** [*options*]

## DESCRIPTION

Complete a topic branch by merging it to its parent branch according to the configured merge strategy. This command works with any topic branch type (feature, release, hotfix, support, or custom types).

The finish operation follows a strict state machine with these steps:
1. **Merge**: Merges the topic branch to its parent branch using the configured upstream strategy
2. **Create Tag**: Optionally creates and signs tags (if configured)
3. **Update Children**: Updates any child branches that have `autoUpdate=true` using their downstream strategies
4. **Delete Branch**: Optionally deletes the topic branch (local and/or remote)

The operation maintains a persistent state file that allows it to resume after conflicts. If conflicts occur during any merge operation (main merge or child updates), the state is saved and the operation can be continued with **--continue** or aborted with **--abort**.

## ARGUMENTS

*topic*
: The topic branch type (feature, release, hotfix, support, or any configured custom type)

*name*
: Name of the topic branch to finish. If omitted when using the shorthand **git-flow finish**, the current branch is used.

## OPTIONS

### Operation Control

**--continue**, **-c**
: Continue the finish operation after resolving merge conflicts

**--abort**, **-a**
: Abort the finish operation and return to the original state

**--force**, **-f**
: Force finish: skip remote branch sync check and allow finishing non-standard branches. When used, bypasses the safety check that prevents finishing when the local branch is behind its remote tracking branch.

### Tag Creation

**--tag**
: Create a tag for the finished branch (overrides configuration)

**--notag**
: Don't create a tag for the finished branch (overrides configuration)

**--sign**
: Sign the tag cryptographically with GPG

**--no-sign**
: Don't sign the tag cryptographically

**--signingkey** *keyid*
: Use the given GPG key for the digital signature

**--message**, **-m** *message*
: Use the given message for the tag

**--messagefile** *file*
: Use contents of the given file as tag message

**--tagname** *name*
: Use the given tag name instead of the default

### Branch Retention

**--keep**
: Keep the topic branch after finishing (don't delete)

**--no-keep**
: Delete the topic branch after finishing (default behavior)

**--keepremote**
: Keep the remote tracking branch after finishing

**--no-keepremote**
: Delete the remote tracking branch after finishing

**--keeplocal**
: Keep the local branch after finishing

**--no-keeplocal**
: Delete the local branch after finishing

**--force-delete**
: Force delete the branch even if not fully merged

**--no-force-delete**
: Don't force delete the branch (default)

### Merge Strategy Control

**--rebase**
: Rebase topic branch before merging (overrides configured strategy)

**--no-rebase**
: Don't rebase topic branch (use configured strategy)

**--squash**
: Squash all commits into single commit (overrides configured strategy)

**--no-squash**
: Keep individual commits (don't squash)

**--squash-message** *message*
: Custom commit message for squash merge. This is a CLI-only option with no git config equivalent, as squash messages are specific to each branch being finished.

**--merge-message**, **-M** *message*
: Custom commit message for the upstream merge operation (topic branch to parent). This is a CLI-only option with no git config equivalent, as merge messages are specific to each branch being finished. Useful for teams using commit message validation hooks (e.g., conventional commits) where auto-generated messages like "Merge branch 'feature/foo'" would be rejected. Supports placeholders (see MESSAGE PLACEHOLDERS below).

**--update-message** *message*
: Custom commit message for child branch update operations (parent to child branches). When finishing a release or hotfix, child branches like develop are automatically updated from the parent. This option allows customizing those merge commit messages. This is a CLI-only option with no git config equivalent. Supports placeholders (see MESSAGE PLACEHOLDERS below).

**--preserve-merges**
: Preserve merges during rebase operations

**--no-preserve-merges**
: Flatten merges during rebase (default)

**--no-ff**
: Create merge commit even for fast-forward cases

**--ff**
: Allow fast-forward merge when possible (default)

### Remote Fetch Options

**--fetch**
: Fetch from remote before finishing the branch (default). This fetches both the base branch and the topic branch to ensure the latest remote changes are known before merging. Overrides git config setting `gitflow.<type>.finish.fetch`.

**--no-fetch**
: Don't fetch from remote before finishing. Disables the default fetch behavior. Overrides git config setting `gitflow.<type>.finish.fetch`.

## REMOTE SYNC CHECK

Before performing the merge operation, the finish command checks if the local topic branch is in sync with its remote tracking branch. This safety check prevents accidental data loss when the remote has commits that are not present locally.

### Sync Status Behavior

**Equal**: Local and remote are at the same commit. Finish proceeds normally.

**Ahead**: Local has commits not pushed to remote. Finish proceeds with an informational note about unpushed commits.

**Behind**: Remote has commits not present locally. Finish **aborts with an error** to prevent discarding those changes.

**Diverged**: Both local and remote have unique commits. Finish **aborts with an error** since the branches have diverged.

**No Tracking**: Branch has no remote tracking branch configured. Finish proceeds normally (no remote to compare against).

### Bypassing the Check

Use the **--force** flag to bypass the remote sync check:

```bash
git flow feature finish --force my-feature
```

This is useful when you intentionally want to discard remote changes, such as when the remote commits were experimental or should not be included in the merge.

### Resolving Sync Issues

When finish aborts due to being behind the remote, you have several options:

```bash
# Option 1: Update your branch with remote changes first
git flow feature update my-feature

# Option 2: Pull changes directly
git pull

# Option 3: Force finish (discards remote changes)
git flow feature finish --force my-feature
```

## MERGE STRATEGIES

The merge strategy used when finishing follows a three-layer precedence system:

**merge**
: Standard Git merge creating a merge commit (preserves branch history)

**rebase**
: Rebase topic branch onto parent creating linear history

**squash**
: Combine all topic branch commits into a single commit

### Strategy Precedence

The merge strategy follows a three-layer precedence system (highest to lowest):

1. **Command-line flags**: `--rebase`, `--squash`, `--no-rebase`, `--no-squash` (highest priority)
2. **Command-specific config**: `gitflow.<type>.finish.rebase`, `gitflow.<type>.finish.squash`
3. **Branch defaults**: `gitflow.branch.<type>.upstreamstrategy` (lowest priority)

### Additional Options

The following options modify strategy behavior:

- **--preserve-merges**: Only valid with rebase operations
- **--no-ff**: Forces creation of merge commits, even for fast-forward cases
- **--ff**: Allows fast-forward merges when possible (default)

## MESSAGE PLACEHOLDERS

Custom merge and update messages can include placeholders that are automatically expanded with branch names. This allows creating dynamic commit messages without hardcoding branch names.

### Supported Placeholders

| Placeholder | Description | Example Value |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **%b** | Branch name | `feature/my-feature` |
| **%B** | Full refname | `refs/heads/feature/my-feature` |
| **%p** | Parent branch name | `develop` |
| **%P** | Full parent refname | `refs/heads/develop` |
| **%%** | Literal percent sign | `%` |

### Context for Placeholders

**For --merge-message** (topic branch to parent):
- `%b` = the topic branch being merged (e.g., `feature/my-feature`)
- `%p` = the parent branch receiving the merge (e.g., `develop`)

**For --update-message** (parent to child branches):
- `%b` = the child branch being updated (e.g., `develop`)
- `%p` = the source branch (e.g., `main`)

### Examples

```bash
# Simple branch name placeholder
git flow feature finish my-feature --merge-message "feat: merge %b"
# Result: "feat: merge feature/my-feature"

# Branch and parent placeholders
git flow feature finish my-feature --merge-message "feat: merge %b into %p"
# Result: "feat: merge feature/my-feature into develop"

# Child updates with placeholders
git flow release finish 1.0 --update-message "chore: sync %b from %p"
# Result on develop: "chore: sync develop from main"

# Escaped percent sign
git flow feature finish my-feature --merge-message "100%% complete: %b"
# Result: "100% complete: feature/my-feature"
```

## EXAMPLES

### Basic Usage

Finish current topic branch (shorthand):
```bash
git flow finish
```

Finish specific feature branch:
```bash
git flow feature finish user-authentication
```

Finish release branch with tag:
```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0 --tag
```

### Handling Conflicts

When conflicts occur during finish:
```bash
# Start finish operation
git flow feature finish my-feature

# Conflicts occur, resolve them manually
git add conflicted-files
git commit

# Continue the finish operation
git flow feature finish my-feature --continue
```

Or abort if needed:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --abort
```

### Tag Management

Create signed tag with custom message:
```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0 --sign --message "Release version 1.2.0"
```

Use specific GPG key:
```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0 --sign --signingkey ABC123DEF
```

### Merge Strategy Examples

Force rebase strategy regardless of configuration:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --rebase
```

Squash all commits into single commit:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --squash
```

Rebase with preserved merges:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --rebase --preserve-merges
```

Create merge commit even for fast-forward:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --no-ff
```

Override configured squash with regular merge:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --no-squash
```

Squash with custom commit message:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --squash --squash-message "feat: add login functionality"
```

### Custom Merge Commit Messages

Use custom merge message for conventional commits:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --merge-message "feat(auth): add user authentication"
```

Custom messages for both merge and child updates:
```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.0 \
  --merge-message "release: version 1.2.0" \
  --update-message "chore: sync develop with main after release 1.2.0"
```

### Branch Retention

Keep branch for backporting:
```bash
git flow hotfix finish 1.1.1 --keep
```

Clean up both local and remote:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature --no-keeplocal --no-keepremote
```

## WORKFLOW BEHAVIOR

### Dual Merge Pattern

For release and hotfix branches, finish typically performs dual merges:
1. **Topic → Parent**: Merge the topic branch to its parent (e.g., release → main)
2. **Parent → Develop**: Merge parent back to develop to synchronize branches

### Child Branch Updates

After merging to the parent, any child branches configured with `autoUpdate=true` will be automatically updated with the new changes from their parent branch. Each child branch uses its own configured downstream strategy for receiving updates.

The update process:
1. Checks out each child branch in sequence
2. Merges the parent branch using the child's downstream strategy
3. If conflicts occur, saves state and prompts for resolution
4. Continues with next child branch after successful update

Only branches with `autoUpdate=true` are updated:
```bash
git config gitflow.branch.develop.autoUpdate true
```

## CONFIGURATION

Finish behavior is controlled by these configuration keys:

### Branch-Level Defaults
```bash
git config gitflow.branch.<type>.upstreamStrategy merge
git config gitflow.branch.<type>.tag true
```

### Command-Level Overrides
```bash
# Merge strategy overrides
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.rebase true
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.squash false
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.preserve-merges true
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.no-ff true

# Tag creation overrides
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.sign true
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.signingkey ABC123DEF

# Remote fetch options
git config gitflow.<type>.finish.fetch true
```

## EXIT STATUS

**0**
: Successful finish operation

**1**
: Topic branch not found

**2**
: Git operation failed (conflicts, etc.)

**3**
: Invalid branch name or configuration

**4**
: Merge conflicts require manual resolution

**5**
: Tag creation failed

**6**
: GPG signing failed

## NOTES

- Merge strategy follows three-layer precedence: CLI flags > config > branch defaults
- Command-line flags always override any configuration settings
- **--preserve-merges** flag only applies to rebase operations
- **--squash** and **--rebase** flags are mutually exclusive when both set explicitly
- Use **--continue** and **--abort** for conflict resolution
- Tag creation behavior varies by topic branch type configuration
- The **git-flow finish** shorthand automatically detects current topic branch type
- Child branches are automatically updated when their parent changes
- Some topic branch types (like releases and hotfixes) may create tags by default
- Custom merge messages (**--merge-message**, **--update-message**, **--squash-message**) are CLI-only options with no git config equivalent
- Custom messages are preserved in merge state and survive conflict resolution
