// Package hooks provides filter and hook execution for git-flow operations.
//
// Filters transform input/output values (e.g., version numbers, tag messages).
// Hooks execute scripts before/after operations (e.g., pre-flow-feature-start).
//
// All scripts are located in .git/hooks/ following these patterns:
//   - Filters: filter-flow-{type}-{action}-{target}
//   - Hooks: {pre,post}-flow-{type}-{action}
