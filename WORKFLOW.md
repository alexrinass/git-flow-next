# Development Workflow

This project serves as an experiment in how much of the development and maintenance lifecycle can be automated with AI-assisted tooling, while also making it easy for contributors to follow a consistent, standardized workflow.

This document describes our structured approach to development tasks, from issue creation through to merged pull requests.

## Overview

Our workflow follows a consistent pattern that ensures quality, traceability, and thorough documentation at each stage:

```
Issue/Concept → Planning → Implementation → Review → PR → Merge
```

Key artifacts are stored in `.ai/`, organized by issue or feature:

```
.ai/
├── issue-42-squash-merge/
│   ├── analysis.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── pr_summary.md
└── feature-custom-branch-types/
    ├── concept.md
    ├── plan.md
    └── pr_summary.md
```

> **Note**: The `.ai/` directory is not committed to git. These are working artifacts.

## 1. Issues (Bugs, Improvements, Smaller Features)

For bug fixes, improvements, and smaller features that don't require extensive upfront design.

### Process

1. **Create Issue**
   - `/gh-issue` - Create GitHub issue following our issue guidelines
   - Use appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, etc.)
   - Reference related issues if applicable

2. **Analyze & Document**
   - `/analyze-issue <number>` - Analyze the issue
   - Creates folder `.ai/issue-<number>-<slug>/`
   - Writes analysis to `analysis.md`
   - Include:
     - Root cause analysis (for bugs)
     - Impact assessment
     - Affected files/components
     - Proposed approach
     - Edge cases to consider

3. **Add Context Comments**
   - Propose inline comments in relevant source files
   - Mark areas that need attention: `// TODO(#<issue>): <description>`
   - This helps track issue context directly in code

4. **Proceed to Planning**
   - Move to the [Implementation](#3-implementing) phase

### Issue Analysis Template

```markdown
# Issue #<number>: <title>

## Summary
<Brief description of the issue>

## Analysis

### Root Cause (for bugs)
<What's causing this behavior>

### Affected Components
- `path/to/file.go` - <why>
- `path/to/other.go` - <why>

### Proposed Solution
<High-level approach>

### Edge Cases
- <Case 1>
- <Case 2>

### Testing Considerations
<What needs to be tested>
```

---

## 2. Larger Features

For significant new functionality that requires upfront design and planning.

### Process

1. **Create Concept Document**
   - Create folder `.ai/feature-<name>/`
   - Write concept to `concept.md`
   - Include:
     - Problem statement / motivation
     - Proposed solution
     - Alternative approaches considered
     - Architecture impact
     - API/CLI changes
     - Migration considerations (if applicable)
     - Open questions

2. **Concept Review**
   - Share concept with team for feedback
   - Iterate on design based on feedback
   - Resolve open questions

3. **Proceed to Planning**
   - Once concept is approved, move to [Implementation](#3-implementing)

### Concept Template

```markdown
# Feature: <name>

## Problem Statement
<What problem does this solve? Why is it needed?>

## Proposed Solution
<Detailed description of the approach>

## Architecture

### Components Affected
- <Component 1>: <changes>
- <Component 2>: <changes>

### New Components
- <New component>: <purpose>

## API/CLI Changes
<New commands, flags, configuration options>

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: <name>
<Description, pros, cons>

### Option B: <name>
<Description, pros, cons>

## Migration / Compatibility
<Any breaking changes or migration steps>

## Open Questions
- [ ] <Question 1>
- [ ] <Question 2>
```

---

## 3. Implementing

The implementation phase transforms issues or concepts into working code.

### Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   - For issues: `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
     - Example: `feature/42-add-squash-merge`
   - For larger features: `feature/<feature-name>`
     - Example: `feature/custom-branch-types`
   - Use `git flow feature start` for branch creation

2. **Create Implementation Plan**
   - `/create-plan` - Generate implementation plan from issue analysis or concept
   - Writes to `plan.md` in the workflow folder
   - Include:
     - Step-by-step implementation tasks
     - File-by-file changes
     - Dependencies between tasks
     - Checkpoints for testing

3. **Validate Test Approach**
   - `/validate-tests` - Review plan against [TESTING_GUIDELINES.md](TESTING_GUIDELINES.md)
   - Ensures adequate test coverage is planned
   - Adds/refines test cases in the plan
   - Considers:
     - Unit tests for new functions
     - Integration tests for command behavior
     - Edge cases and error conditions

4. **Implement**
   - Execute the implementation plan (Claude or `/implement`)
   - Follow [CODING_GUIDELINES.md](CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
   - Commit incrementally using `/commit`
   - Run tests frequently: `go test ./...`

5. **Local Review**
   - `/local-review` - Self-review against [REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md](REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)
   - Generates review notes

6. **Address Review Findings**
   - Fix any issues identified in local review
   - Update tests if needed
   - Ensure all tests pass

### Implementation Plan Template

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: <branch-name>

## Source
- Issue: #<number> (link)
- Concept: <name> (if applicable)

## Overview
<Brief summary of what will be implemented>

## Tasks

### 1. <Task Name>
- [ ] <Subtask>
- [ ] <Subtask>
- Files: `path/to/file.go`

### 2. <Task Name>
- [ ] <Subtask>
- Files: `path/to/file.go`, `path/to/other.go`

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] `TestFunctionName` - <what it tests>
- [ ] `TestOtherFunction` - <what it tests>

### Integration Tests
- [ ] `TestCommandBehavior` - <scenario>

## Checkpoints
1. After Task 1: <what should work>
2. After Task 2: <what should work>

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `docs/<relevant>.md`
- [ ] Update command help text
```

---

## 4. Committing

All commits must follow our commit message standards.

### Process

- `/commit` - Commit changes according to [COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md](COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md)
- Uses conventional commit format:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>

  <body>

  <footer>
  ```
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Reference issues: `Resolves #<number>` or `Relates to #<number>`

### Examples

```
feat(finish): add squash merge strategy

Add --squash flag to finish command that performs a squash merge
instead of a regular merge. This creates a single commit containing
all changes from the topic branch.

Resolves #42
```

```
fix(start): validate branch name before creation

Check that the branch name doesn't contain invalid characters
before attempting to create it. Previously, git would fail with
a cryptic error message.

Resolves #57
```

## 5. Pull Requests

The final stage before code reaches the main branch.

### Process

1. **Publish Branch**
   - Push feature branch to remote
   - `git flow feature publish <name>` or `git push -u origin <branch>`

2. **Create PR Summary**
   - `/pr-summary` - Generate PR summary following [PR_SUMMARY_GUIDELINES.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
   - Writes to `pr_summary.md` in the workflow folder
   - Includes:
     - Summary of changes
     - Test plan / verification steps
     - Screenshots (if UI changes)
     - Breaking changes (if any)

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Open PR against appropriate base branch
   - Link related issues
   - Add appropriate reviewers
   - Apply relevant labels

4. **External Review (Service)**
   - AI-assisted review for additional perspective
   - Automated checks (CI, linting, tests)

5. **Human Review**
   - Team member reviews the PR
   - Address feedback
   - Iterate until approved

6. **Merge**
   - Squash and merge (preferred) or merge commit
   - Delete feature branch after merge
   - Close related issues

### PR Summary Template

```markdown
# PR: <title>

## Summary
<1-3 bullet points describing the changes>

## Related Issues
