<!-- Focus on what areas of the codebase were touched and key decisions, not line-by-line details. -->
<!-- Keep it concise — avoid excessive formatting; just write prose, no need for sub-headers here. -->
<!-- Link to resolved issues with "Resolves #ISSUE" (only if no commit already contains a closing keyword). -->

## Notes

<!-- Call out risks and edge cases: Flag breaking changes or areas needing careful review -->
