<!-- Start with the "why": Lead with the problem or goal, not implementation details -->
<!-- Be concise but complete: Cover what changed, why, and key decisions -->
<!-- Avoid excessive formatting: The intro doesn't need a header -->
<!-- Link to resolved issues: End with "Resolves #ISSUE" only if no commit contains a closing keyword -->

## Notes

<!-- Call out risks and edge cases: Flag breaking changes or areas needing careful review -->
<!-- Keep the scope clear: Note if something is intentionally left out or part of a larger effort -->
<!-- Remove this section if not applicable -->

## Test Coverage

<!-- Confirm test coverage: Note that tests were added and highlight interesting edge cases -->
<!-- Remove this section for documentation-only changes -->
