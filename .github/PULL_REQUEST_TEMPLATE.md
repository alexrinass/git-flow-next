<!-- EXAMPLE:
Adds `--merge-message` flag to customize merge commit messages during finish operations.

The implementation supports both CLI flags and git config with placeholder expansion (`%b` for branch, `%p` for parent). Messages persist through conflict resolution. Changes touch `cmd/finish.go`, `internal/git/repo.go`, and `internal/mergestate/mergestate.go`.

Resolves #58

## Remarks

- Squash message remains CLI-only since content is branch-specific
- Both upstream and child merges support custom messages

**Review focus:**
- `cmd/finish.go:142-168` - placeholder expansion logic
- `internal/mergestate/mergestate.go` - new persistence fields
